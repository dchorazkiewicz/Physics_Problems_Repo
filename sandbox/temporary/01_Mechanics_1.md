# Section 1: Mechanics I

## 1. Projectile Motion

A projectile is fired from the ground with an initial velocity of $100 	\text{ m/s}$ at an angle of $37^\circ$ above the horizontal. Calculate:

a) The maximum height reached.

b) The total time of flight.

c) The horizontal range of the projectile.

## 2. Range Optimization

For projectile motion, show analytically that the maximum range for a given initial velocity is achieved at a launch angle of $45^\circ$.

## 3. Path Intersection

Alice is moving along a path described by $A(t) = (2+t, 8-3t)$ and Bob is moving along a path $B(t) = (2t-1, 2t+2)$. Determine if their paths intersect. Will they collide at the same time?

## 4. 2D Collision

Two cannons are aimed at each other. The first cannon at $(0,0)$ fires a projectile with an initial velocity of $[100 \text{ m/s}, 80 \text{ m/s}]$. The second cannon at $(800	\text{ m}, 0)$ fires a projectile with a velocity of $[-100 \text{ m/s}, 80 \text{ m/s}]$. At what time $t$ and at what point $(x,y)$ will they collide?

## 5. Relative Velocity

A river flows east at $2 \text{m/s}$. A boat that can travel at $5 \text{m/s}$ in still water wants to go directly north across the river. In what direction (angle) should it head? How long will it take to cross the river if it's 200 meters wide?

## 6. Variable Velocity

An object's velocity is given by $v(t) = t^2 + 2t - 5$. If the object is at $x=4$ at $t=0$, what is its position at $t=3$?

## 7. Vertical Collision

A stone is thrown vertically upward with a speed of $20 \text{m/s}$. A second stone is thrown vertically upward with a speed of $30 \text{m/s}$ exactly one second later. At what time and height do they collide?

## 8. Circular Motion

Calculate the centripetal acceleration of a person standing on the Earth's equator. The Earth's radius is approximately 6378 km.

## 9. Momentum Comparison

Which has greater momentum: a 2-gram fly flying at $10$ m/s or a 60-gram tennis ball moving at $1$ m/s?

## 10. Vector Calculus

The position of an object is given by $\vec{r}(t) = (3t^2)\hat{i} + (5t - 8t^2)\hat{j}$. Find the object's velocity and acceleration vectors as a function of time.

## 11. Kinematics I

Assume that a supersonic jet-powered aircraft, from the moment it starts moving on the runway until it reaches its final velocity, moves with uniformly accelerated motion with acceleration $a$. After a time $T$ from the moment the aircraft started, an explosive charge detonates at the same spot on the runway.

a) What condition must be met for the sound wave to reach the aircraft (neglecting effects related to the attenuation of wave energy with increasing distance)?

b) Determine the time at which the aircraft and the sound wave will be at the same point in space at the same instant.

c) Solve the problem using the graphical method. Consider all possible cases.

## 12. Kinematics II

The water level in a well is slowly decreasing with a constant velocity $v_1$. We drop a stone into the well, and after time $t_1$ we hear a splash. After time $T$ from the moment of dropping the first stone, we drop a second stone into the well. The sound of the stone hitting the water surface reaches us after time $t_2$ from the moment it was released. Assuming that the speed of sound in air $v \gg v_1$, find:

a) the velocity of the lowering water level $v_1$,

b) the distance of the water surface from the ground level at the moment the second stone is released.

## 15. Kinematics V

In planar motion, the velocity vector $v$ and acceleration vector $a$ form a constant angle equal to $\alpha$. Prove that the velocity magnitude in this motion changes according to the formula:

$$
v = v_0 e^{-(\varphi - \varphi_0)\cot\,\alpha}
$$

where $v_0 = v(0)$, and $\varphi_0 = \varphi(0)$ is the angle of the velocity vector with any selected direction at time $t=0$.
