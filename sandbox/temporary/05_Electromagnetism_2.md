## 1. Gauss's Law

A point charge of $+2 \text{ C}$ is located at the origin. Calculate the electric flux through a spherical surface of radius $1 \text{ m}$ centered at the origin.

## 2. Ampere's Law

Two long, parallel wires are $10 \text{ cm}$ apart and carry currents of $5 \text{ A}$ in opposite directions. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point midway between the wires.

## 3. Biot-Savart Law

A small segment of wire of length $0.1 \text{ m}$ carries a current of $3 \text{ A}$. The segment is located at a distance of $0.2 \text{ m}$ from a point $P$. Calculate the magnetic field at point $P$ due to this current segment (assume the segment is perpendicular to the line connecting it to point $P$).

## 4. Magnetic Torque

A rectangular loop of wire with dimensions $10 \text{ cm}$ by $5 \text{ cm}$ carries a current of $2 \text{ A}$. A uniform magnetic field of $B = 0.3 \text{ T}$ is applied parallel to the plane of the loop. What is the magnitude of the magnetic torque on the loop?

## 5. EM Wave Analysis

An electromagnetic wave has its electric field component described by $E_y(x,t) = 100 \sin(10^7 x - \omega t) \text{ V/m}$. What is the direction of propagation? What is the wavelength $\lambda$? What is the angular frequency $\omega$? What is the equation for the magnetic field component?

## 6. Wavelength and Frequency

The human eye is most sensitive to light with a wavelength of about $550 \text{ nm}$. What color does this correspond to in the visible spectrum? What is the frequency of this light?

## 7. EM Spectrum

List the following types of electromagnetic radiation in order of increasing wavelength: Infrared, Ultraviolet, Microwaves, X-rays, Radio waves, Gamma rays.

## 8. Refraction (Snell's Law)

A light ray travels from air ($n=1.00$) into glass ($n=1.50$). If the angle of incidence is $30^\circ$, what is the angle of refraction?

## 9. Speed of Light in Media

What is the speed of light in a diamond, which has an index of refraction $n = 2.42$?

## 10. Brewster Angle

Light in air strikes a glass surface with refractive index $n = 1.50$. At what angle of incidence does reflected light become fully polarized?
