# Section 9: Astronomy and Astrophysics

## 1. Scale Comparison

How many times farther is the Sun from Earth compared to the Moon from Earth? (Sun-Earth distance $\approx 150 \times 10^6$ km; Moon-Earth distance $\approx 384,000$ km).

## 2. Angular Size

Calculate the angular size (in degrees) of the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth. Sun's diameter $\approx 1.39 \times 10^6$ km; Moon's diameter $\approx 3,474$ km. Why do they appear to be roughly the same size? If the Moon were the size of a basketball (about 24 cm in diameter), how big would the Sun be in this scale model? (Sun's diameter $\approx 1.39 \times 10^6$ km).

## 3. Rotational Velocity

Calculate the linear speed (in km/s) of a point on the Earth's equator due to its rotation. Earth's radius $\approx 6378$ km.

## 4. Orbital Mechanics

Calculate the orbital speed of the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits at an altitude of approximately 400 km above the Earth's surface. (Earth's mass $M_E \approx 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg). Compare this speed of Earth's orbital speed around the Sun (Earth-Sun distance $\approx 150 \times 10^6$ km, Earth's orbital period $\approx 365.25$ days). Which is faster, the ISS around the Earth or Earth in its orbit around the Sun?

## 5. Microgravity

What is the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) at the altitude of the ISS (400 km)? Why do astronauts experience a state of "weightlessness" despite this gravity?

## 6. Geostationary Orbit

Satellites in geostationary orbit remain above the same point on Earth. What must their orbital period be? Calculate the altitude of a geostationary orbit above the Earth's surface.

## 7. Escape Velocity

What is the escape velocity from the surface of the Moon? (Moon's mass $M_M \approx 7.35 \times 10^{22}$ kg; whereas Moon's radius $R_M \approx 1,737$ km). Result express in km/s and as a fraction of Earth's escape velocity (Earth's escape velocity $\approx 11.2$ km/s).

## 8. Solar Gravity

Calculate the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Sun. By what factor would your weight increase if you could stand on its surface? (Sun's mass $M_S \approx 2 \times 10^{30}$ kg; Sun's radius $R_S \approx 6.96 \times 10^8$ m).

## 9. Megastructures

A "Dyson Sphere" is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star to capture its energy output. If the mass of Mercury ($3.3 \times 10^{23}$ kg) were used to build a solar panel sphere with a surface density of 10 kg/m², what would be the radius of the sphere?

## 10. Interplanetary Travel

How much time would it take to get from Earth to Mars when Mars is at its closest approach (55 million km)

a) for a message sent at the speed of light?

b) by spacecraft traveling at a constant speed of 40,000 km/h = 11.11 km/s?

c) by "airplane" traveling at a constant speed of 900 km/h typical for intercontinental flights?
