# Section 12: Modern Physics II (Quantum Mechanics)

## 1. Quantum Numbers

For the $n=3$ energy level in a hydrogen atom, what are the possible values for the quantum numbers $l$ (orbital) and $m_l$ (magnetic)? How many distinct electron states exist for $n=3$?

## 2. Energy Scaling

State the general dependence of energy E on the principal quantum number n (i.e., $E \propto n^?$) for:

a) A particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.

b) An electron in a hydrogen atom.

## 3. Photon Energy

Calculate the energy (in eV) of a photon with a wavelength of 500 nm. Use the formula $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$ where $h = 4.1357 \times 10^{-15}$ [eVs] and $c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$.

## 4. Radioactive Half-Life

The half-life of Cobalt-60 is 5.27 years. If a sample initially contains 100 grams of Cobalt-60, how much will remain after approximately 21 years?

## 5. Alpha Decay

Give a specific, balanced nuclear equation for an alpha decay process, starting with Uranium-238 (${}^{238}_{92}\text{U}$). 

## 6. Beta Decay

Give a specific, balanced nuclear equation for a beta-minus decay process, starting with Carbon-14 (${}^{14}_{6}\text{C}$). 

## 7. Pair Annihilation

An electron and a positron, each with a rest mass of $0.511 \text{MeV/c}^2$, annihilate each other, producing two photons of equal energy. What is the energy (in MeV) and wavelength of each photon?

## 8. Quark Model

What is the quark composition of a proton and a neutron? Use this to verify their electric charges (u quark charge = +2/3 e, d quark charge = -1/3 e).

## 9. Quantum Well Energy

An electron is in a 1D infinite potential well of width $L = 0.5$ nm. It is in the $n=2$ state. What is the energy of the electron in eV?

## 10. Wavefunction Probability

For a particle in a 1D box of length L, the wavefunction for the ground state is $\Psi(x) = \sqrt{2/L} \sin(\pi x/L)$. Calculate the probability of finding the particle in the region $0 \le x \le L/4$. Then calculate the probability of finding the particle in the region $L/4 \le x \le L/2$. Which region is more likely to contain the particle?
