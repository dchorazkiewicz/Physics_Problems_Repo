# Section 6: Circuits

## 1. Series and Parallel Circuit

You have three resistors, $R_1=15\,\Omega$, $R_2=30\,\Omega$, and $R_3=50\,\Omega$ and a 12 V battery.

a) Draw the circuit diagram.

b) Calculate the total equivalent resistance.

c) Calculate the current flowing from the battery.

Perform parts a), b), and c) separately for purely series and purely parallel configurations of the three resistors.

## 2. Mixed Circuit

A resistor $R_1=10\,\Omega$ is connected in series with a parallel combination of two other resistors, $R_2=20\,\Omega$ and $R_3=20\,\Omega$. The entire circuit is connected to a 6 V source. What is the total current drawn from the source?

## 3. Resistors

You have a supply of exactly three $1\,\Omega$ resistors. What are all the possible equivalent resistances you can create by combining them. List all unique values and draw the corresponding circuit diagrams.

## 4. Resistors again

You have some supply of $1\,\Omega$ resistors. How can you combine them to create an equivalent resistance of $2.5\,\Omega$?

## 5. Kirchhoff's Laws

Using Kirchhoff's laws, find the currents $I_1, I_2, I_3$ in a circuit with two loops. Loop 1 (left): a 10V battery and a $2\Omega$ resistor, shared branch in the middle. Loop 2 (right): a 5V battery and a $3\Omega$ resistor. The shared branch has a $5\Omega$ resistor. Assume currents are flowing out of the positive terminals.

## 6. Kirchhoff's Laws again

For a circuit consisting of a 2V battery and a 1-ohm resistor in the left loop, and a 1V battery and a 3-ohm resistor in the right loop, with a 2-ohm resistor in the middle branch, calculate all currents.

## 7. Capacitors in Parallel

Two capacitors, $C_1=4\,\mu\text{F}$ and $C_2=6\,\mu\text{F}$, are connected in parallel to a 10 V battery. What is the total charge stored on the capacitors? What is the total energy stored?

## 8. Capacitor mixed

## 10. AC Voltage Equation

The current in an AC circuit is given by $I(t) = 2 \sin(120\pi t)$. If the circuit consists of a single $50\,\Omega$ resistor, what is the equation for the voltage $V(t)$ across it?

## 11. Average Current

## 12. Current

Charge flowing through the wire is given by function of time $Q(t) = 5t^2+5$. What is the current at $t=3$ s?

## 13. Power & Energy

What is the power dissipated by a $100\,\Omega$ resistor when a voltage of 50 V is applied across it? How much energy is consumed in 5 minutes?

## 14. Transformer Currents

A transformer has a primary coil with 1000 turns and a secondary coil with 200 turns. If the primary voltage is $120\text{ V}$ (AC), what is the secondary voltage? If the current in the secondary is $3\text{ A}$, what is the current in the primary?

## 15. Transformer Ratio

A transformer is used to step down the voltage from 120 V AC to 9.0 V AC. If the primary coil has 400 turns, how many turns must the secondary coil have?

## 16. RLC Circuit

Write down the differential equation for  a series RLC circuit with a voltage source $V$, a resistor $R$, an inductor $L$, and a capacitor $C$. Assume the current is $I(t)$ and the voltage across the capacitor is $V_C(t)$. Compare this to the equation of a damped harmonic oscillator. What are the analogies between the terms in the two equations?

## 17. RLC Impedance
