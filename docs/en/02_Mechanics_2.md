## Section 2: Mechanics II

1.  **Gravitational Dependence:** A simple pendulum has a period of 4 seconds on Earth. What would its period be on the Moon, where the gravitational acceleration is about 1/6th of Earth's?

2.  **Inelastic Collision:** A 70 kg runner moving at $3 \text{ m/s}$ jumps onto a 140 kg stationary cart. What is the final speed of the cart with the runner? Is kinetic energy conserved in this collision? Explain.

3.  **Simple Harmonic Motion:** A 10 kg mass is attached to a spring and oscillates according to the equation $x(t) = 0.2 \cos(10\pi t)$ (in meters). What is the spring constant $k$? What is the total mechanical energy of the system?

4.  **Conservation of Energy:** A pendulum with a length of 1.0 meter is released from an initial angle of $15^\circ$. What is the speed of the pendulum bob at the bottom of its swing?

5.  **Energy & Momentum Combination:** A 0.5 kg block slides down a frictionless track from a height of 3.0 m. At the bottom, it collides and sticks to a 1.5 kg block which is initially at rest. What is the speed of the combined mass just after the collision?

6.  **Horizontal Projectile:** A stone is thrown horizontally with a speed of $20 \text{ m/s}$ from the top of a cliff that is 50 m high. How far from the base of the cliff does the stone land?

7.  **Dynamics with Friction:** A 5 kg block is placed on a 10 kg block. A horizontal force of 45 N is applied to the 10 kg block, and the 5 kg block is tied to the wall. The coefficient of kinetic friction between all moving surfaces is 0.2. Find the acceleration of the 10 kg block.

8.  **Pendulum Design:** What is the required length of a simple pendulum to have a period of exactly 1 second on Earth?

9.  **Kinematics Integration:** The velocity of an object is given by $v(t) = 4t + 5$. Find the displacement $x(t)$ and acceleration $a(t)$, assuming $x(0)=0$.

10. **Energy Dissipation:** A tennis ball is dropped from a height of 2.0 m. After each bounce, it loses 30% of its mechanical energy. To what height does it rise after the second bounce?
