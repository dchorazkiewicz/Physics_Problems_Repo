# Physics Problems

## Getting Started

Upon receiving the link to this repository, you must fork it immediately to your own GitHub account. All your work must be done on your own copy. Commit your changes regularly to prevent data loss.

## Course Timeline and Structure

The course covers 4 distinct problems. You have 3 weeks to work on each problem, covering a total semester plan of 12 weeks. The repository is organized into four main directories inside the documentation folder.

* `problem_1`
* `problem_2`
* `problem_3`
* `problem_4`

## Student Workflow

For each problem directory, you will find the following structure.

* `problem_formulation.md`: The description of the task.
* `problem_solution.md`: Your workspace. Use this file to document your solution, notes, and methodology. You are free to adapt the structure of this note to your needs.
* `assets/`: A folder for your resources. You are required to upload your HTML simulations, images, and other supporting files here.

## Requirements and Expectations

* **Documentation**: You must fill out the `problem_solution.md` for each problem.
* **Simulations**: Functional HTML simulations are required and should be placed in the `assets` folder.
* **Commit Policy**: Commit your changes regularly to your forked repository. This is your proof of work.

## AI Policy

AI usage is strongly encouraged. You are expected to use AI tools (LLMs, Agents) to generate code, create HTML simulations, and write documentation. Treat AI as a powerful assistant.

## Grading Criteria

* **Minimum Requirement (Pass)**: All 4 problems must have completed notes and functional HTML simulations present in the repository.
* **Higher Grades**: Awarded for the quality of materials, the sophistication of the simulations, and your presentation. You must demonstrate a deep understanding of the generated solutions and simulations during the class presentation.

**Note on MkDocs**: Technically advanced students are encouraged to use the MkDocs framework to deploy their results as a live website. While not required, this will be viewed very positively.
