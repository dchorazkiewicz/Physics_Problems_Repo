# Section 11: Cosmology and Relativity

## 1. Cosmic Chronology

Place the following events of the early universe in chronological order: Recombination (formation of neutral atoms), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Inflation, Formation of first galaxies, Quark-gluon plasma era.

## 2. Hubble's Law

According to Hubble's Law ($v = H_0 d$), and using $H_0 \approx 70 \text{ (km/s)/Mpc}$, at what distance would a galaxy be receding from us at the speed of light? This defines the approximate size of the observable universe.

## 3. Galactic Year

Our Solar System orbits the center of the Milky Way (a distance of about 27,000 light-years) at a speed of about 220 km/s. How long does it take to complete one orbit (a "galactic year")?

## 4. Time Dilation

A muon has an average lifetime of $2.20\,\mu\text{s}$ in its own rest frame. If it travels at $0.990c$, what will its average lifetime be as measured by an observer on Earth?

## 5. Length Contraction

What speed must a 1-meter-long ruler have for its length to be observed as 0.5 meters due to length contraction?

## 6. Mass-Energy

The "Little Boy" atomic bomb converted about 0.7 grams of mass into energy. Using $E=mc^2$, calculate the energy released in Joules. (1 kiloton of TNT is approx. $4.184 \times 10^{12}$ J).

## 7. Twin Paradox (Lite)

An astronaut spends one year on the ISS, which travels at about 7.66 km/s. How much younger would the astronaut be than their twin on Earth due to time dilation?

## 8. Velocity Transformation

A rocket traveling at $0.8c$ away from Earth shoots a probe forward at $0.5c$ relative to the rocket. What is the probe's speed as measured by an observer on Earth?

## 9. High Energy Physics

How much energy (in GeV) is required to accelerate a proton from rest to a speed of $0.99c$? The rest mass of a proton is about $938 \text{ MeV/c}^2$.

## 10. Relativistic Mass

What is the relativistic mass of a 1000 kg car traveling at 99.9% of the speed of light?
