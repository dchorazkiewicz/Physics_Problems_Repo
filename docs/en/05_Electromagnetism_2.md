## Refraction (Snell's Law)

A light ray travels from air (n=1.00) into glass (n=1.50). If the angle of incidence is $30^\circ$, what is the angle of refraction?

## Lorentz Force

A charged particle with charge $q = 2 \times 10^{-19}$ C and mass $m = 4 \times 10^{-27}$ kg enters a magnetic field of $B = 0.5$ T at a speed of $v = 10^6$ m/s perpendicular to the field. What is the magnitude of the Lorentz force acting on the particle?

## Photon Energy

The human eye is most sensitive to light with a wavelength of about 550 nm (in vacuum). What is the frequency of this light? What is its energy in electron-volts (eV)?

## EM Wave Analysis

An electromagnetic wave has its electric field component described by $E_y(x,t) = 100 \sin(10^7 x - \omega t) \text{ V/m}$. What is the direction of propagation? What is the wavelength $\lambda$? What is the angular frequency $\omega$? What is the equation for the magnetic field component?

## Ampere's Law Application

Two long, parallel wires are 10 cm apart and carry currents of 5 A in opposite directions. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at a point midway between the wires.

## Transformer Ratio

A transformer is used to step down the voltage from 120 V AC to 9.0 V AC. If the primary coil has 400 turns, how many turns must the secondary coil have?

## Magnetic Torque

A rectangular loop of wire with dimensions 10 cm by 5 cm carries a current of 2 A. A uniform magnetic field of B = 0.3 T is applied parallel to the plane of the loop. What is the magnitude of the magnetic torque on the loop?
