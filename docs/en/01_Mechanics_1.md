## Section 1: Mechanics I

1.  **Projectile Motion Analysis:** A projectile is fired from the ground with an initial velocity of $100 	ext{ m/s}$ at an angle of $37^\circ$ above the horizontal. Calculate:
    a) The maximum height reached.
    b) The total time of flight.
    c) The horizontal range of the projectile.

2.  **Range Optimization:** For projectile motion, show analytically that the maximum range for a given initial velocity is achieved at a launch angle of $45^\circ$.

3.  **Path Intersection:** Alice is moving along a path described by $A(t) = (2+t, 8-3t)$ and Bob is moving along a path $B(t) = (2t-1, 2t+2)$. Determine if their paths intersect. Will they collide at the same time?

4.  **2D Collision Trajectories:** Two cannons are aimed at each other. The first cannon at $(0,0)$ fires a projectile with an initial velocity of $[100 	ext{ m/s}, 80 	ext{ m/s}]$. The second cannon at $(800	ext{ m}, 0)$ fires a projectile with a velocity of $[-100 	ext{ m/s}, 80 	ext{ m/s}]$. At what time $t$ and at what point $(x,y)$ will they collide?

5.  **Relative Velocity (River Problem):** A river flows east at $2 	ext{ m/s}$. A boat that can travel at $5 	ext{ m/s}$ in still water wants to go directly north across the river. In what direction (angle) should it head? How long will it take to cross the river if it's 200 meters wide?

6.  **Variable Velocity:** An object's velocity is given by $v(t) = t^2 + 2t - 5$. If the object is at $x=4$ at $t=0$, what is its position at $t=3$?

7.  **Vertical Collision:** A stone is thrown vertically upward with a speed of $20 	ext{ m/s}$. A second stone is thrown vertically upward with a speed of $30 	ext{ m/s}$ exactly one second later. At what time and height do they collide?

8.  **Circular Motion:** Calculate the centripetal acceleration of a person standing on the Earth's equator. The Earth's radius is approximately 6378 km.

9.  **Momentum Comparison:** Which has greater momentum: a 2-gram fly flying at 10 m/s or a 60-gram tennis ball moving at 1 m/s?

10. **Vector Calculus:** The position of an object is given by $\vec{r}(t) = (3t^2)\hat{i} + (5t - 8t^2)\hat{j}$. Find the object's velocity and acceleration vectors as a function of time.
