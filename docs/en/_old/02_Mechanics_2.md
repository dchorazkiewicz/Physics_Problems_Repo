## 18. Dynamics

A ping-pong ball loses $1/k$ fraction of its kinetic energy after hitting the floor. Find the total distance the ball will travel when dropped from height $h$ until it stops. Coefficient $k>1$.

## 19. Dynamics

A stone of mass $m$ was thrown with velocity $v_0$ into a well where the water level is at depth $d$. Assume that the stone falls freely in the air, while in the water a resistance force proportional to velocity acts on it:

$$
F = -kv
$$

Find the dependence of the stone's position, velocity, and acceleration on time.

## 20. Dynamics

Following the stone from the previous problem, a second stone of the same mass and with the same velocity was thrown into the well after time $T$. What will be the time dependence of the distance $D$ between the stones?

## 21. Dynamics

A ball of mass $m$ was thrown vertically upwards with velocity $v_0$. The air resistance force acting on the ball is given by the formula:

$$

## 22. Dynamics

Solve the problem of projectile motion in a gravitational field when a resistance force proportional to velocity acts on the moving body. Find the equations of motion, the maximum height, and the time to reach it. Discuss the case when the resistance force is much smaller than the body's weight.

## 23. Dynamics

A small ball of mass $m$ slides without friction down the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. At what point and with what velocity will the ball detach from the sphere?

## 24. Dynamics

Find the solution to the previous problem in the case where the ball starts from the top of the sphere with a velocity $v_0 \neq 0$.

Note. The cases $v_0 \le \sqrt{gR}$ and $v_0 > \sqrt{gR}$ should be discussed separately.
