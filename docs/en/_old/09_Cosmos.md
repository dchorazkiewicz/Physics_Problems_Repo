# Section 9: Cosmos

## 1. Density Comparison

Instead of just stating the difference, calculate the average density of the Solar System (mass $\approx M_{Sun}$, volume within Pluto's orbit $\approx 40 \text{ AU}$) versus the Milky Way galaxy (mass $\approx 10^{12} M_{Sun}$, volume $\approx$ disk $100\text{kly} \times 1\text{kly}$). Compare the orders of magnitude.

## 2. Galactic Geometry

The Milky Way galaxy has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 1,000 light-years. What is the ratio of its diameter to its thickness?

## 3. Cosmic Timeline

How long after the Big Bang did the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation originate? What temperature did the universe cool to at that moment (approx.)?

## 4. Fermi Estimation

The Milky Way contains approximately 200 billion stars. If these were distributed equally among Earth's 8 billion people, how many stars would each person get?

## 5. Space Travel Kinetics

The minimum distance from Earth to Mars is about 55 million km. How long would it take a spacecraft traveling at a constant speed of 40,000 km/h to reach Mars?

## 6. Galactic Collision

The Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away and is moving towards our Milky Way at about 110 km/s. Estimate how long it will be until the two galaxies collide.

## 7. Light Delay

A message is sent from Earth to a probe orbiting Jupiter, which is 600 million km away. How long does the message take to arrive? (Use the speed of light, $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$). 

## 8. Astronomical Units

What is an "Astronomical Unit" (AU)? Express the average distance from Earth to the Sun in kilometers and light-minutes.

## 9. Expansion Evidence

What specific observation of distant galaxies (redshift) made by Edwin Hubble led to the conclusion that the universe is expanding?

## 10. Solar Light Time

How long does it take for light from the Sun to reach Earth?
