# Section 7: Circuits II

## 1. Capacitors in Parallel

Two capacitors, $C_1=4\,\mu\text{F}$ and $C_2=6\,\mu\text{F}$, are connected in parallel to a 10 V battery. What is the total charge stored on the capacitors? What is the total energy stored?

## 2. Capacitors in Series

The same two capacitors ($C_1=4\,\mu\text{F}$ and $C_2=6\,\mu\text{F}$) are now connected in series to the 10 V battery. What is the charge on each capacitor and the voltage across each capacitor?

## 3. RLC Impedance

A series RLC circuit has $R=20\,\Omega$, $L=10 \text{ mH}$, and $C=50\,\mu\text{F}$. It is connected to an AC source with a frequency of 100 Hz.
    a) Calculate the inductive reactance ($X_L$).
    b) Calculate the capacitive reactance ($X_C$).
    c) Calculate the total impedance (Z) of the circuit.

## 4. Resonance

For the RLC circuit in the previous problem, what is the resonant frequency? What would the impedance of the circuit be at resonance?

## 5. Transformer Currents

A transformer has a primary coil with 1000 turns and a secondary coil with 200 turns. If the primary voltage is 120 V (AC), what is the secondary voltage? If the current in the secondary is 3 A, what is the current in the primary (assuming an ideal transformer)?

## 6. AC Voltage Equation

The current in an AC circuit is given by $I(t) = 2 \sin(120\pi t)$. If the circuit consists of a single $50\,\Omega$ resistor, what is the equation for the voltage $V(t)$ across it?

## 7. RC Decay

A 5 F capacitor is connected to a DC voltage source. A graph of current vs. time shows the current starts at 2A and exponentially decays to 0. What was the voltage of the source? (Hint: consider the initial state).

## 8. Capacitor Network

Find the equivalent capacitance for a circuit where a $10\,\mu \text{F}$ capacitor is in series with a parallel combination of a $5\,\mu \text{F}$ capacitor and a $20\,\mu \text{F}$ capacitor.

## 9. Semiconductor Theory

Describe the function of a semiconductor diode in a circuit. What is a "band gap" and how does it relate to conductivity?

## 10. Charge Storage

How much charge is stored on a $100\,\mu\text{F}$ capacitor when it is connected to a 20 V source?
