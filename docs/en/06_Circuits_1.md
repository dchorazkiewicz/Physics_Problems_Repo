a) Draw the circuit diagram.
b) Calculate the total equivalent resistance.

A resistor $R_1=10\,Ω$ is connected in series with a parallel combination of two other resistors, $R_2=20\,Ω$ and $R_3=20\,Ω$. The entire circuit is connected to a 6 V source. What is the total current drawn from the source?

## 4. Kirchhoff's Laws

Using Kirchhoff's laws, find the currents $I_1, I_2, I_3$ in a circuit with two loops. Loop 1 (left): a 10V battery and a $2\Omega$ resistor, shared branch in the middle. Loop 2 (right): a 5V battery and a $3\Omega$ resistor. The shared branch has a $5\Omega$ resistor. Assume currents are flowing out of the positive terminals.
