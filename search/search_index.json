You must demonstrate a deep understanding of the generated solutions and simulations during the class presentation.</li> </ul> <p>Note on MkDocs: Technically advanced students are encouraged to use the MkDocs framework to deploy their results as a live website. While not required, this will be viewed very positively.</p>"},{"location":"problem_1/problem_formulation/","title":"Problem Formulation","text":""},{"location":"problem_1/problem_solution/","title":"Solution/Note","text":"<p>Enter your solution here</p>"},{"location":"problem_2/problem_formulation/","title":"Problem Formulation","text":""},{"location":"problem_2/problem_solution/","title":"Solution/Note","text":"<p>Enter your solution here</p>"},{"location":"problem_3/problem_formulation/","title":"Problem Formulation","text":""},{"location":"problem_3/problem_solution/","title":"Solution/Note","text":"<p>Enter your solution here</p>"},{"location":"problem_4/problem_formulation/","title":"Problem Formulation","text":""},{"location":"problem_4/problem_solution/","title":"Solution/Note","text":"<p>Enter your solution here</p>"}]}
